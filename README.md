Sebastian Lague Portals Video and Github repo for portal implementation (same one we'll use): https://youtu.be/cWpFZbjtSQg | https://github.com/SebLague/Portals/tree/master

Note on this: His implementation of portals is ingenius. Math a little over my head but great video to watch if you want to understand how matrices can help with calculating how much of the world a portal should display through the camera. 

* Used VRCMods to find the emotes .anim pack
* Tommy already owned the 3d model assets (minus environment assets)

This particular video helped me troubleshoot how to shoot the portals. Ended up doing the shooting from scratch anyway but it helped me figure out the logic LOL
