Sebastian Lague Portals Video and Github repo for portal implementation (same one we'll use): https://youtu.be/cWpFZbjtSQg | https://github.com/SebLague/Portals/tree/master

Note on this: His implementation of portals is ingenius. Math a little over my head but great video to watch if you want to understand how matrices can help with calculating how much of the world a portal should display through the camera.
